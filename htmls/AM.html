                <h3 id="tt">A Experimental</h3>
                <p>Arctic Monkeys have made an art out of dignified risk-taking in their career, and 2013’s AM was an
                    exercise in experimentation, masterfully executed.
                    Most musical acts are hard to put to maintain both relevance and quality throughout their entire
                    career; Arctic Monkeys, though, have made simultaneous mainstream success and critical acclaim look
                    effortless. In fact, despite one of the most explosive debut albums in the history of pop music,
                    they peaked internationally with their fifth album: the tour-de-force that was 2013’s AM.
                </p>
                <h3>Vocal Production</h3>
                <p>Vocal Multiplication
                    Another striking element of AM is the band’s soul-redolent layering of lead and backing vocals. It
                    became routine for Turner to re-record his lead vocals up an octave for the sake of doubling.
                    Helders then backed up Turner’s falsetto with his own, also up the octave, while O’Malley provided
                    yet another layer with an octave down from the original key. The “ooh la la la” outro of Mad Sounds
                    is arguably the primmest example of this vocal feast.

                <h3 id="lyrics">Poetic Lyrics</h3>

                <p>
                    Technical tricks aside, one of the immediate charms of AM is the simultaneously effusive and
                    tongue-in-cheek way it goes about expressing universal experiences. Take album closer I Wanna Be
                    Yours, a musical reworking the work by punk poet John Cooper Clarke. Opening with the line “I wanna
                    be your vacuum cleaner/breathe in your dust” it’s a beautifully comical love song delivered
                    completely straight.
