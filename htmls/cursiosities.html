                <h3>Curiosities</h3>
                <p> The band was criticized by the head of the National Health Service in Scotland because the cover of
                    their first album depicted Chris McClure, a friend of the band, smoking a cigarette.
                    The actual picture on the CD was of an ashtray, as well. The Scottish NHS saw this as "reinforcing
                    the idea that smoking is OK."
                </p>

                <p> All four band members grew up together in High Green, a northern suburb of Sheffield. They've known
                    each other since they were all seven years old.
                </p>

                <p>In the early days of the band, they refused to sign a record contract with any label. Labels and
                    scouts wanted the band to change their songs, but the band refused. The went so far as to refuse
                    scouts guaranteed entry into their gigs. When they finally signed with Domino because of the "do it
                    yourself" attitude of founder, Lawrence Bell, who ran the label from his own house.</p>

            <div id="textBio">

                <p> Arctic Monkeys was the first band in the history of the awards to win ShockWaves NME Award for both
                    categories, Best New Band and Best British Band at the same night in 2006.
                </p>

                <p> All four members of the band were devoted fans of Hip-Hop when then were younger. For some members,
                    like Alex Turner and Matt Heders, things changed when they heard certain bands. For Alex, it was The
                    Strokes and The Libertines and for Matt, it was seeing Queens of the Stone Age at a local music
                    festival.

                    The Artick Got Discovered In 2003 when they hosted local shows and performed demo recordings, which
                    grew their fanbase. The band even got recognition from BBC Radio due to their early fame. They
                    signed a deal with Domino Records in 2005 and released two singles.
                </p>

                <p>Arctic Monkeys named by punk poet. The Arctic Monkeys arrived at their name because of punk performer
                    John Cooper Clarke. The band's frontman, Alex Turner, explained the 62-year-old poet had encouraged
                    them in their nascent days and was one of the first people to show an interest in their name.</p>
                <p>'505' Labelled by many as the greatest Arctic Monkeys song of all time, '505', which featured on
                    their second album 'Favourite Worst Nightmare', was never released as a single.</p>
